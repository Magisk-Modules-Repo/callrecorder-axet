# Axet's Call Recorder

This module installs axet's [Call Recorder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.callrecorder/)
as a system app, allowing it to use the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` system permission to properly record calls.

Minimum supported API is 19 (Android 4.4). This module is probably not needed on older Android versions anyway.


## Features

* Compatible with F-Droid updates: update the app to the latest version via F-Droid.
* Systemless: this module does not alter your system.


## How to use

* Install the module using Magisk Manager (either by downloading the module within the app
or by manually downloading [a zip from releases](https://github.com/di72nn/callrecorder-axet/releases)).
* Reboot.
* Open Call Recorder, modify settings as desired (you might want to leave "Recording Source" on "Auto";
there's **NO** need to use root (for "System Mixer Incall Recording") in the app).
* Activate call recording by checking the "Calls Recording" checkmark, grant requested permissions.
* Enjoy!
